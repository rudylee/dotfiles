  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing
  # I've given in 14 spacing which fits really well with my fonts, you may change it
  # to your convenience but make sure to adjust 'glyph_offset' appropriately post that
  offset:
   x: 0
   y: 5

  # Note: This requires RESTART
  # By default when you change the offset above you'll see an issue, where the texts are bottom
  # aligned with the cursor, this is to make sure they center align.
  # This offset should usually be 1/2 of the above offset-y being set.
